# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
#
Book.create!([
  {title: "The life of a turtle"}
  {title: "book2"}
  {title: "book3"}
  {title: "book4"}
  {title: "book5"}
  {title: "book6"}
  {title: "book7"}
  {title: "book8"}
  {title: "book9"}
